Notes:
1. Score - 125/100 (Bonus part full marks)

2. Specs not required to be taken care of:
    - length modifiers
    - '*' flags
    
3. Momo compiles the program using -Wall -Wextra -Werror flags, if a certain test case is tested using the original printf and it does not compile
with the following error flags specified, it can then be assumed that momo does not test for those test cases.
